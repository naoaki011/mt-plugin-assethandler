# Asset Handler

Asset Handler provides bulk importing of existing files into the Movable Type Asset Manager, and the ability to edit asset file metadata that is not provided by default by Movable Type.

This version of Asset Handler is compatible with Movable Type 4.0 and later, including MT5.0x and MT5.1x.

Movable Type 4.0 introduced a file manager-like system called "Asset Manager" that lists files that had been uploaded through MT, and allows you to easily add them to entries or pages.  Since many users consider adopting the Asset Manager after using Movable Type for a period of time, there are often questions about how to deal with files that have already been uploaded into the file system. These files don't show up in the Asset Manager listing screens.  The only way you can have them appear in the Asset Manager has been to re-upload them.

One other problem is that Movable Type provides no way to edit information associated with existing assets. Therefore, the only way you can enter an asset's name or description is during the upload process.  In many situations, users in a rush click through the Asset Manager upload wizard, forgetting to provide those file details.  The corresponding entry in the Asset Manager ends up with no title or description!

Asset Handler which provides two crucial features that should make using assets in Movable Type a far more enjoyable experience:

- A Batch Edit option to the drop down menu on the asset listing screens which is almost identical to the batch-edit option on the entry listing. Simply select the assets you wish to edit, choose Batch Edit and easily edit the title, description and tags for the chosen assets.

- An importer allows you to easily import existing files on your server into Movable Type as assets. A wizard guides you through the entire process and makes it a breeze to import a single file or an entire folder!
